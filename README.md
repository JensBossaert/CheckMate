# CheckMate

On [this page](https://jensbossaert.github.io/fabzero-JensBossaert/Project/) you can find the documentation (in Dutch) of my graduation project for the FabZero course, by [Ingegno](https://ingegno.be/). The project aims to provide an electronic game board for various abstract games and retro video games, featuring an 8 x 8 grid of squares with integrated push buttons and LED lights. I used an Adafruit Pro Trinket microcontroller. This Github hosts the code to be uploaded to the Trinket for various games.
